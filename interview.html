    <div class="setlist-box">
        <p>1. What is your name, year, and major, and which group are you in?</p>
        <p>2. Which sets are you performing this Yotonix (script counts)?</p>
        <p>3. How long does each choreography take to learn/create?</p>
        <p>4. How do you think Yotonix, as a performance hosted by performance groups, is different from events like Celebrasia,
            hosted by cultural organizations?</p>
        <p>5. How do the Yotonix specific choregraphies differ to the sets performed at guest performances?</p>
        <p>6. How are Revolution/Photonix sets different from other guest performers' sets at other events (not Yotonix)?</p>
        <p>7. Do you enjoy Yotonix or guest performances more? Why?</p>
        <p>8. Can you please describe the cultural origins of Revolution/Photonix? It is ok if you don't know</p>
        <p>9. Do you view Revolution/Photonix as a cultural group, or as a performance group?</p>

    <div class="setlist-box">
        <p>1. Owen Su, Sophomore in Computer Engineering</p>
        <p>2. Main set, Set 2, Interweave, Collab, Vertax</p>
        <p>3. Creating took us like 5 hours. To learn, I've spent 6-7 hours on each choreo so far. Actually probably like 13-14 hours</p>
        <p>4. Our main purpose is to just put on a show, so we can bring random acts like Taekwondo, GMen;
            whereas events like Celebrasia with culture groups are more about spreading awareness about their culture, which makes them more limited
            in what they can do/what groups they can invite.</p>
        <p>5. Easier because of the volume of them, but fundamentally they are no different. Except for collab.
            I think collab, since we are coordinating with Photonix, we have to use a lot more teamwork and collaboration
            to make everything sync, in order to make a more exciting choreography.
        </p>
        <p>6. Ours is more about the props, our yoyos, our glowsticks. Whereas dance groups, they focus on them, their dancing, their music.</p>
        <p>7. I enjoy Yotonix more because it allows me to work more closely with Revo/Photo members, and it's our own show, and I feel proud that it's our own show.</p>
        <p>8. IDK</p>
        <p>9. Owen: I view Revolution as more of a performance-focused group, but through our performances we spread awareness about our culture.</p>
        <p>Ethan: What culture?</p>
        <p>Owen: Asian-American Culture.</p>

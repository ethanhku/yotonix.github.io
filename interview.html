    <h3 class="center">Owen Su</h3>
    <div class="setlist-box">
        <p>1. Owen Su, Sophomore in Computer Engineering</p>
        <p>2. Main set, Set 2, Interweave, Collab, Vertax</p>
        <p>3. Creating took us like 5 hours. To learn, I've spent 6-7 hours on each choreo so far. Actually probably like 13-14 hours</p>
        <p>4. Our main purpose is to just put on a show, so we can bring random acts like Taekwondo, GMen;
            whereas events like Celebrasia with culture groups are more about spreading awareness about their culture, which makes them more limited
            in what they can do/what groups they can invite.</p>
        <p>5. Easier because of the volume of them, but fundamentally they are no different. Except for collab.
            I think collab, since we are coordinating with Photonix, we have to use a lot more teamwork and collaboration
            to make everything sync, in order to make a more exciting choreography.
        </p>
        <p>6. Ours is more about the props, our yoyos, our glowsticks. Whereas dance groups, they focus on them, their dancing, their music.</p>
        <p>7. I enjoy Yotonix more because it allows me to work more closely with Revo/Photo members, and it's our own show, and I feel proud that it's our own show.</p>
        <p>8. IDK</p>
        <p>9. Owen: I view Revolution as more of a performance-focused group, but through our performances we spread awareness about our culture.</p>
        <p>Ethan: What culture?</p>
        <p>Owen: Asian-American Culture.</p>

    <h3 class="center">Andy Jiang</h3>
    <div class="setlist-box">
        <p>1. Andy Jiang, Senior, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Revolution</p>
        <p>2. Set 1, Interweave, Collab, Revo main set, script</p>
        <p>3. Depends on the person, on average, choreo takes 4-6 hours to create, and anywhere between 1-10 hours to learn.</p>
        <p>4. I think that our performance is much more cohesive and celebrates performance arts better compared to events like Celebrasia.
            We have higher production value, and we can center our performance around a theme, which may not be possible elsewhere.</p>
        <p>5. Choreographers typically utilize more creative tricks like dancing, instead of just yoyo in main set, as that is our public face.
            Having more opportunities for more people to choreo and pick music generates more creativity in the choreography.
        </p>
        <p>6. We are generally more diverse because we use a larger variety of music from more cultural backgrounds, as opposed to groups like KGayo3,
            that stick to one culture. Can't really speak to style, since we don't have more than one style in Revo either. But culturally, we are more diverse.
        </p>
        <p>7. I prefer Yotonix because we have much more control of what we can do, much more creative freedom, more time on stage.
            Yotonix is meant for us, instead of just being one part of another performance.
        </p>
        <p>8. Photonix is not a cultural organization, so there aren't any cultural origins. Revolution was formed in 2009 by a group of Chinese-American students interested in Chinese yoyo as a performance art.</p>
        <p>9. Again, Photonix is not affiliated with any culture, so they are simply a performance group. I don't think Revolution could be categorized as "more" of a performance or cultural group, since those are not mutually exclusive and our performance is inherently cultural.</p>

    <h3 class="center">Annie Lu</h3>
    <div class="setlist-box">
        <p>1. Annie Lu, Senior, MCDB, Photonix</p>
        <p>2. Photonix Set 1, Photonix Set 2, Photonix big set, Collab, script</p>
        <p>3. Anywhere from 1-3 hours to learn. Anywhere from 1-5 hours to create. I can learn it in an hour, but it won't look good.
            Or I can learn it for 6 hours to make it look good.
        </p>
        <p>4. I feel like we're more focused on engaging/entertaining the crowd, compared to educating the crowd.</p>
        <p>5. Are they different? I feel like our semester sets try to encapsulate all of our music and prop diversity.
            But for Yotonix, we can try more niche things, since we have more sets to be more diverse.
        </p>
        <p>6. We're more novel</p>
        <p>7. Ummmmmm... I feel like I enjoy them for different reasons, because guest performances let us showcase our performances to
            more different types of audiences and events, and lets our members come together more to perform, which is fun.
            But Yotonix is overall more rewarding because we put so much more work into it, and the show is just focused on us. IDK, it's just fun
            because we work towards this big goal together and show everyone we can do it.
        </p>
        <p>8. I'm assuming diabolo is from Chinese culture, IDK the history too much, but it seems Chinese. Flow arts originated from Polynesian islands.
            From fire-spinning, but we have obviously deviated a bit from it, and more modernly integrated into Asian-American culture, because of raves and things.
        </p>
        <p>9. I view Photonix as a performance group, and Revolution mostly as performance, but still kind of cultural because it comes more directly from Chinese culture.</p>

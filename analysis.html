            <h1>Analysis</h1>        
        <p>Throughout the responses, we can see that Yotonix is described as a show that focuses on the performance aspects of Revolution and Photonix.
            This show offers higher production value compared to cultural event shows like Celebrasia or DVN, as these are identified as mainly for
            awareness about culture, instead of being focused on the performance. Because of this, both the Revolution and Photonix members believe
            that Yotonix is more rewarding, but that big cultural events, because of the exposure to very big crowds, are very fun in that aspect.
        </p>
        
        <p>In terms of the actual performance, I also agree that the performances in Yotonix are incredibly unique and fun to watch. For example,
            my personal favorite is the Glowsuits. In terms of the choreographies that get performed, they are more creative, ambitious, and plentiful.
            There are also an increased number of props and sets that are performed, such as the Collab set and Glowsuits.
        </p>

        <p>
            Compared to other groups, Revolution and Photonix are props-based groups, compared to dance groups that focus on themselves,
            their dances, and their music. This results in Revolution and Photonix becoming much more surprising groups on stage.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The clubs both have cultural origins, which most Revolution members do not realize, and Photonix members only recognize the origins of flow arts.
        Revolution's Chinese yoyo comes from an ancient Chinese toy, that was also once employed in Chinese opera. Photonix's flow arts originate from
        the New Zealand islands, specifically from the Maori colonists, mainly in the Poi tradition. These Poi are traditionally used for Haka, and are
        wielded by the women. Both of these props used by the clubs have long, rich histories that aren't very recognized by either club, both during
        their performances and within their knowledge, besides Photonix members knowledge of their own art form. Revolution members do not know about
        the cultural origins of either, and Photonix members also do not know about the origins of Chinese yoyo.
        </p>

        <p>This leads me to believe that both clubs have steered away from their cultural connection, and are now mostly performance-based.
            This is further supported by the interview responses, where the trend is that members believe, while the clubs are inherently cultural,
            have shifted to being more performance-focused. Additionally, a sentence from Revolution member David Jin intrigued me, where he explained
            that he believes many Revolution members see yoyo as a hobby, and thus don't feel the need to connect to the culture.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my opinion, I believe that this phenomenom exists because Revolution and Photonix are very diverse groups, that don't focus on the music
            or choregraphies of where their props originated from. Therefore, they aren't naturally inclined to seek out those answers, because they
            aren't necessary or barriers to performing.

    <h2 class="center">What is Yotonix?</h2>
    <div class="box">
        <p>Yotonix is an annual performance held jointly by Revolution Chinese Yoyo and Photonix at the University of Michigan.</p>
        <p>The name: "Yotonix" comes from combining "Yoyo" and "Photonix"</p>
        <br>
        <p class="too-wide">Yotonix was started in the spring of 2017. Each year, it features unique choreographies from Revolution and Photonix not performed
            at any other performances on campus. The show also includes a hilarious skit and a collaboration between both Revolution and Photonix members, as well
            as a special Glowsuit set. Finally, a multitude of guest performers are invited each year.

    <h3 class="center">AMCULT 352 Term Project:</h2>
    <div class="box">
        <p class="too-wide">
            AMCULT 352, crosslisted as ASIANPAM 352, involves the study of A/PIA cultural performances on the U-M Ann Arbor campus. 
            The class conducts a critical examination of collegiate culture night shows, focusing on Asian/Pacific Islander American 
            communities, and including processes of preparation and production as well as the content of these shows. It also performs a 
            discussion of the multiple levels of meaning and representation that operate in these shows.
        </p>
        <p class="too-wide">
            This term project has the objective of being an original contribution to the pool of information on student-organized performance 
            and culture shows in UM's Asian American and Pacific Islander student communities.

            <p class="still-too-wide">Thesis:</p>
            <p class="still-too-wide">
                What goes into creating Yotonix, a show created and run by performance groups? How does this contrast to what 
                Revolution and Photonix perform at other guest performances?
            </p>
            <p>How Revolution and Photonix moved away from cultural connection, and transitioned to the performance aspect of both groups?</p>

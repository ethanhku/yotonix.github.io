##AMCULT 352 WN '25 Term Project - Yotonix 2025
This is the website for Ethan Ku's AMCULT 352 Term Project

This project aims to study "How is Yotonix, as an inherently non-culturally-specific performance, still significant in comparison to other culture shows on campus, such as DVN and Celebrasia."

#Sections to add:
1) My thoughts
2) Media - photos and video from this year's show
3) Thoughts before and after
4) Differences between Yotonix and guest performances
5) Why do I need to make this? (Not just a culture show, have a lot of those already, MAASU article, panethnic ideas because doesn't identify just one)
6) Snipes - culture of the performance groups, sister groups, etc...
